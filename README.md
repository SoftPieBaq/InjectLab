# InjectLab ðŸ”¬

**InjectLab** is a modular command-line injection framework designed for learning.  
It lets you inject content into files using a flexible **core + extension** model.  

Whether youâ€™re exploring **red-team payloads** or **blue-team defenses**, InjectLab gives you a safe environment to understand how injection works, how malicious activities are built, and how they can be detected or defended against.
