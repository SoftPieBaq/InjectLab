# InjectLab 🔬

**InjectLab** is a modular command-line injection framework designed for learning.  
It lets you inject content into files using a flexible **core + extension** model.

## ⚔️ Red vs Blue

🔴 Red: Learn how attackers hide, evade, and deliver payloads.

🔵 Blue: Learn how defenders can scan, detect, and respond.

InjectLab helps you see both sides.

## 📖 Learning Focus

InjectLab is not a weapon.
It’s an educational framework designed to help you:

* Understand how injection works

* Build your own extensions

* Detect malicious patterns

* Train red & blue skills in one place
